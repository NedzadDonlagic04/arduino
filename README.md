# arduino

In this repository I will be storing all the
arduino related things I do. Inside the howItLooks
folder you can see a picture of video of the
project.

Under this there will be a short description
for all the projects I've done so far.

Project 1_LED:
In this project I take a LED diode and turn it on.

For this project I used:
- 1x Arduino UNO
- 1x Arduino Charging Cable
- 1x Breadboard
- 2x Wires
- 1x Resistor
- 1x LED (In my case it was green but it can be any color)

Project 2_LEDx4:
In this project I take 4 LEDs and have them turn on one
after another in a loop.

For this project I used:
- 1x Arduino UNO
- 1x Arduino Charging Cable
- 1x Breadboard
- 5x Wires
- 4x Resistor
- 4x LED (In my case it was green but it can be any color)

Project 3_LED_BTN:
In this project I take a button and set it up so that each
press turns the LED ON/OFF.

For this project I used:
- 1x Arduino UNO
- 1x Arduino Charging Cable
- 1x Breadboard
- 1x Button
- 1x LED
- 2 Resistors
- 5x Wires

Project 4_Wired_Communication:
In this project I took an arduino nano and made it communicate
with the arduino uno in a wired way, when the button on the
arduino uno is pressed the LED connected to the arduino nano
gets turned ON/OFF.

For this project I used:
- 1x Arduino UNO
- 1x Arduino Nano
- 2x Arduino Charging Cable
- 2x Breadboard
- 1x LED
- 1x Button
- 2x Resistors
- 10x Wires

Project 5_Wireless_Communication:
In this project I took an arduino uno and an arduino nano
and had them communicate using the nrf24l01 wireless
transceiver modules. When the button is clicked it sends
a signal through a given channel and turns the led ON or
OFF depending on it's current state.

For this project I used:
- 1x Arduino UNO
- 1x Arduino Nano
- 2x Arduino Charging Cable
- 1x LED
- 1x Button
- 2x Resistors
- 2x nrf24l01 wireless modules
- 21x Wires
